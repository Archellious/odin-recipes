    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>Yaprak sarma is a traditional Turkish dish prepared by rolling minced meat or rice fillings in grape leaves. They’re often referred to as sarma and are among the few unique cuisines that both vegetarians and meatatarians can share. The vegan yaprak sarma recipe uses cooked rice and spices such as fresh parsley, pepper paste, and lemon seasoning instead of minced meat. This makes it equally delicious.

        The meatatarian recipe can use different types of meat, including chicken and beef. They are usually rolled in cigar sizes, after which they’re steamed and coated with olive oil.</p>
